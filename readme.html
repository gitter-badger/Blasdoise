<h1>Installation: Famous 5-minute install</h1>
<ol>
	<li>Unzip the package in an empty directory and upload everything.</li>
	<li>Open <span class="file"><a href="bd-admin/install.php">bd-admin/install.php</a></span> in your browser. It will take you through the process to set up a <code>bd-config.php</code> file with your database connection details.
		<ol>
			<li>If for some reason this doesn&#8217;t work, don&#8217;t worry. It doesn&#8217;t work on all web hosts. Open up <code>bd-config-sample.php</code> with a text editor like WordPad or similar and fill in your database connection details.</li>
			<li>Save the file as <code>bd-config.php</code> and upload it.</li>
			<li>Open <span class="file"><a href="bd-admin/install.php">bd-admin/install.php</a></span> in your browser.</li>
		</ol>
	</li>
	<li>Once the configuration file is set up, the installer will set up the tables needed for your blog. If there is an error, double check your <code>bd-config.php</code> file, and try again. If it fails again, please go to the <a href="http://blasdoise.com/support/">Support Forums</a> with as much data as you can gather.</li>
	<li><strong>If you did not enter a password, note the password given to you.</strong> If you did not provide a username, it will be <code>admin</code>.</li>
	<li>The installer should then send you to the <a href="bd-login.php">login page</a>. Sign in with the username and password you chose during the installation. If a password was generated for you, you can then click on &#8220;Profile&#8221; to change the password.</li>
</ol>
